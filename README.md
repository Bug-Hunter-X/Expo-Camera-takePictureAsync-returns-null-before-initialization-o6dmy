# Expo Camera takePictureAsync returns null before initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to call `takePictureAsync` before the camera has completely initialized. This leads to unexpected behavior and, often, a `null` or `undefined` return value.

## Problem

The `takePictureAsync` method is invoked before the camera component is fully ready.  This typically occurs due to asynchronous operations.  Without proper handling, `this.camera` will be `null` or `undefined`, resulting in errors.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera has finished its initialization process.  This is achieved using the `onCameraReady` callback provided by the Expo Camera API.
